This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree(cost_complexity = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("rpart") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tree_wf <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(tree_spec) %>% 
  add_recipe(Neo_recipe)

param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_tree <- tune_grid(
  tree_wf, 
  resamples = Neo_folds, 
  grid = param_grid
)

best_complexity_tree <- select_best(tune_tree)

tree_dt_final <- finalize_workflow(tree_wf, best_complexity_tree)
tune_tree_final <- fit(tree_dt_final, data = Neo_train)

save(tune_tree_final, tune_tree, file = "tune_tree.rda")
```
